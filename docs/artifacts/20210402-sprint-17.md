# Umami - Sprint # 17

## Summary

 * Umami is on track for Apr 16 release
   * one remaining task left to complete the Taquito integration (simulation)
 * Other workstreams and preparations for the release are on track

## Overview

 * Umami pivoted to using Taquito: on-track, close to completion (90+%)
   * the bulk of the work is due to Taquito not including key storage/management (while tezos-client did)
 * 3 tiered infrastructure in place: Dev/QA/Prod servers
 * Testing Process in place:
   * since last test run, 20 issues identified
   * no showstopping issues have been identified
   * most (50%) are cosmetic in nature
   * burndown visible on [GitLab Issues](https://gitlab.com/nomadic-labs/umami-wallet/umami/-/milestones/16)
