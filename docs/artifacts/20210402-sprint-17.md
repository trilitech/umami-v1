# Umami - Sprint #17

## Synopsis

Umami is on track for Apr 16 release; there is only one remaining task left to complete the Taquito integration (simulation). Other workstreams and preparations for the release are on track as well.

## Overview

 * Umami pivoted to using Taquito: on-track, close to completion (90+%)
 * the bulk of the work is due to Taquito not including key storage/management (while tezos-client did)
 * 3 tiered infrastructure in place: Dev/QA/Prod servers
 * Testing Process in place:
   * since last test run, 20 issues identified
   * no showstopping issues have been identified
   * most (50%) are cosmetic in nature
   * burndown visible on [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/nomadic-labs/umami-wallet/umami/-/milestones/16)

## Goal/Commitment

 * **To have Umami ready for release on April 16** (on track)

 1. (04/06) To publish/post a teaser video: see [teaserA](./20210402-teaserA.mp4) and [teaserB](./20210402-teaserB.mp4) on or around April 6th
 1. (04/16) To make application quietly available for download on April 16th on website

## Discussion - Mobile

Whether Umami can roadmap for a mobile version:

 * the team has mobile expertise
 * Adoption confirms that mobile versions are in most demand
 * Umami architecture allows straightforward port for multi-platform mobile releases

Rough/preliminary estimate--about one month of actual full-time work, but split with ongoing support for live desktop version and other high-priority feature implementations (see backlog/workstreams).
