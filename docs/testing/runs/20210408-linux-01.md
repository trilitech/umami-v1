### Issues to Verify

 * [x] Double import of secret key [#129]
 * [ ] Taquito Fees [#150]

## Issues Found

 * Import screen is misleading if I already have a secret: it asks for a new password for this key, but actually requires the current password.
 * Adding a contact with the same key as another one actually renames the previous contact.
   * After this specific step, if I add another alias with the same name but another key, it has its name and its key, but the one previously overwritten reappears.
 * Adding a contact with an invalid key results in an empty error in the logs.
 * Changing for an unregistered delegate results in an [Object] error in the logs. The console actually gives an the "unregistered" error.
 * Custom fees are not shown in the recap, but correctly set.
 * If I set custom fees and go edit my transaction in a batch afterwards, the fees for this transaction are recalculated and set to the new one.
 * Token batch advanced options: the second and + fees are wrongly computed, and the one shown is actually the sum of all the fees.
 * One transaction seems stuck on 6/6 blocks, while the other above are confirmed.
 * Any kind of transaction: default fees simulated are not the one sent by Taquito.
